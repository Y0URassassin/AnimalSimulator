Description:

Animal Simulator is a text-based survival game where the player is tasked with surviving a set amount of days as an animal to receive an Animal Score. The player must make decisions to gain energy and offspring. Random events occur during and after each day that can potentially increase or decrease a players power and/or offspring. The player dies when energy reaches zero. The player wins when they complete their set number of days in the game. An animal score is given based on how much energy the player has remaining, multiplied by their number of offspring.
